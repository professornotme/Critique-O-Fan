## Basic Details

### Project Description
Critique-O-Fan is a fun, interactive Streamlit app that reviews ceiling fan videos with a touch of movie-critic humor. Upload a video of your spinning fan, get randomized quirky reviews from custom avatars, and see if your fan is working‚Äîall wrapped in a stylish, modern interface. Perfect for entertaining friends or showcasing creative tech!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Confused whether fan is working or not ?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
First, you upload a video of your spinning ceiling fan (no A-list actors required).

Our app gives your fan the red-carpet treatment‚Äîit plays back your video, checks for dramatic spinning action, and then delivers randomized, over-the-top reviews from our panel of quirky, custom-portrait critics.

Think: film festivals meet home appliance‚Äîcomplete with star ratings, silly awards, and a stylish interface.

(Bonus: The site even detects whether your fan is actually spinning, so the critics don‚Äôt waste their applause!)]
